 <h3>Here's More about buying Old Pokémon Games:</h3>
       <p> The overwhelming success of the Pokémon media franchise has been astounding in the last 2 decades. The name Pokémon is the Romanized contraction of the Japanese brand Pocket Monsters. The term Pokémon, in addition to referring to the Pokémon franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 722 known fictional species that have made appearances in Pokémon media as of the release of the sixth generation titles Pokémon X and Y. "Pokémon" is identical in both the singular and plural, as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".
