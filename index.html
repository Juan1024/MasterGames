The overwhelming success of the Pokémon media franchise has been astounding in the last 2 decades. The name Pokémon is the Romanized contraction of the Japanese brand Pocket Monsters. The term Pokémon, in addition to referring to the Pokémon franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 722 known fictional species that have made appearances in Pokémon media as of the release of the sixth generation titles Pokémon X and Y. "Pokémon" is identical in both the singular and plural, as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu". In 1995 the franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri, and is now a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak and Creatures. Pokémon features fictional creatures called Pokémon, and humans known as Pokémon trainers that search for Pokémon, catch them, and train them to battle one another for sport. The franchise first started out as a pair of video games for the original Game Boy, and then later developed into video games, trading cards, animated television shows and movies, comic books, and even toys. As of May 2016, the Pokémon media franchise has grossed revenues worldwide equivalent to 46.2 billion USD. The game first came into conception by Tajiri around 1989 when the very first Game Boy was released. The concept of the entire Pokémon Universe comes from a hobby the young creator had of collecting insects as a boy. Over time this idea evolved into a game where players are designated as Pokémon Trainers and have essentially two goals in mind: complete the entire Pokedex by collecting all the available Pokémon, and train them all to become the best team and win the Pokémon league. With the release of its latest augmented reality game Pokémon Go, the Pokémon franchise is now once again more popular than ever.
